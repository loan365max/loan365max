People who use payday loans are actually pretty typical consumers, which is surprising to some. They have checking accounts, which is a requirement for getting a loan (so they're "banked"). They have income, which is also a requirement, and they make about $30,000 a year on average. (That's about $15 an hour.) Most are also experienced with credit. More than 90 percent have a conventional credit score; most have credit cards, but they are maxed out. Forty-one percent own homes, etc.

So, bottom line: Despite conventional wisdom, most payday borrowers are mainstream financial consumers, and most—7 in 10—use the loans to pay ordinary expenses like bills, not to cover some unexpected emergency.
